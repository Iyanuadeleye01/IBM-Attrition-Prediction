# Vodafone-Customer Churn-Prediction
This repository contains machine learning pipelines for predicting the attrition.
This project focuses on predicting customer attrition for Vodafone using machine learning techniques. Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a company. Accurate prediction of customer attrition can be valuable for proactive customer retention strategies.

DATA

The dataset utilized in this project is obtained from the AZUBI AFRICA database, and it includes both a CSV file and an Excel file supplied by Vodafone. The primary target variable is the "Churn" column, indicating whether a customer has churned (Yes) or not (No).

DATA UNDERSTANDING

Checking for the features and target inconsistencies.
Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis.
Answering analytical questions with visualizations and hypothesis testing.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
